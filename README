Hey this is a template service - anytime I work on something new I just clone
this repo & edit a few config values (ie; name, etc).

The config values are in the Makefile after changing them run:

    make rename

To propogate your config throughout; this will create a new go module and you
can start building things with:

    make

If you don't have go installed you can run:

    make install-scripts

This will download some bash scripts, as with any scripts online, do not run
them without reading them. 

Now install go with either:

    ./sudo install-go linux # for linux
    or     
    ./sudo install-go darwin #for macOS
